title = "Time dilation"
+++

Recently, I came across a concept while listening to the Tim Ferriss podcast called “Time Dilation”

The concept is diluting time so that you can increase your experiential lifespan.

1 week spent in the wilderness can sometimes feel like few months. 

Here are some quick points on creating that effect

- Seek Moments of awe
- Frequently change locations
- Be in enviornments with feeling of vastness - like the wildreness or the sea
- Learn new things
- Try new stuff
- Non verbal interactions, like being with animals
- Reduce your screentime

Here's the video by Tim:  [How I Design My Life for Time Dilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTAk8HwOlXo)
