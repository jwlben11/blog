Title = "Language Learning Guide"
+++
This guide contains everything that you need to learn a language in the shortest amout of time possible. 

I’ll tell you what to do, but I won’t much spend time explaining why this works

##  Learn the most frequent 1000 words using anki. 
- This contains more than 80% of the spoken words
- Anki is a [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) tool. Install it [here](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
- You can find premade decks(collection of cards) [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks). Just search for the language that you want to learn. 
- You can also find high quality decks at [refold](https://refold.la/decks/). 
- Move on to phrases after learning enough vocab. Don’t spend too much time here on “input”. We have to move to “output” soon

## Use Grammar Workbooks
- Find and workout grammar workbooks with increasing difficulty. 
- It’s important that you do the workouts more than reading the grammar books. 
- [Here’s](https://shop.librerialenuvole.it/scheda-libro/fabia-gatti-stella-peyronel/grammatica-in-contesto-strutture-e-temi-di-italiano-per-stranieri-per-le-scuole-superiori-9788820128432-2942259.html) a good one for italian. Use it as a guide on picking good workbooks
